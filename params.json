{"name":"Sterling Cobb","google":" UA-32416576-1","body":"# Hello!\r\n\r\nMy name is Sterling cobb and I'm a Software Engineer. I've been coding since I was 13 and have a deep love for open source and web technologies, but we'll get to that soon. First, a little about myself. I'm 24, living in Utah and feel I'm as creative as they come. I perform improv' comedy (when in Utah where my friends are at) and enjoy fly fishing, golfing, baseball and long boarding. I'm also madly in love with the ocean and have dreams of sailing from Boston to San Francisco someday.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm working for instructure building Canvas, a piece of software that helps manage students and teachers. \r\n\r\n## My Profession (*After all, thats most likely why you are here*)\r\n\r\n**Relevant work history (Ruby on Rails/Agile Stuff)**\r\n\r\n* 1.5 years freelancing/working on my own projects\r\n* 2 years working for www.byways.org (buidling their mobile and CMS)\r\n* apprentice at thoughbot.\r\n* currently at instructure\r\n**The following is a personal ranking of my abilities between 1 - 5.**\r\n\r\n* Ruby: **** (4)\r\n* Ruby on Rails: ***** (4)\r\n* Design Patterns: ** (2)\r\n* RESTful API's: **** (4)\r\n* Postgres: *** (3)\r\n* PostGIS: ** (2)\r\n* Javascript: ***** (4)\r\n* Coffeescript: ***** (4)\r\n* Backbone: **** (4)\r\n* Rspec: **** (4)\r\n* Cucumber: ***** (5)\r\n* Jasmine: ** (2)\r\n* Git: *** (3)\r\n* HTML5/CSS3/SCSS: **** (4)\r\n* Tmux: ** (2)\r\n* VIM: **** (4)\r\n* Capybara: ***** (4)\r\n* Agile Development Process: ***** (5)\r\n* Eye For Design: ***** (5) (At least I think so)\r\n\r\n## Recent Projects\r\n* www.memorysun.com -> This is a personal pet project of mine.\r\n* www.jobcept.com -> The javascript here isn't pretty but I did this site before I knew good js\r\n* www.samplaid.com -> This is a super easy to use code sample sharing website.\r\n* http://tmblr.co/Zq-A5wMMXbPM -> This is the tagging system for www.apptrajectory.com It's 100% tested in jasmine, cucumber and Backbone.js\r\n\r\n## Sample Code\r\nSince I wrote a code sample site, I figured I would use that to link to my code samples (yes I know gist exists)\r\n\r\nHere are all of my code samples: \r\nhttp://samplaid.com/fourcolors\r\n\r\nMost specifically:\r\n\r\n**Testing Code**\r\n* http://samplaid.com/samples/8 -> Extending Cucumber's World\r\n* http://samplaid.com/samples/9 -> Writing Cucumber Features (including a @wip tag)\r\n* http://samplaid.com/samples/10 -> Cucumber Step Definitions with jQuery and Capybara\r\n* http://samplaid.com/samples/11 -> Rspec with factory girl\r\n\r\n**Backbone.js**\r\n* http://samplaid.com/samples/12 -> Implemented tags on www.apptrajectory.com Used a jQuery plugin and backbone support with the leave method to prevent memory leaks.\r\n* http://samplaid.com/samples/13 -> Jasmine test for Backbone.js application (test for the tags seen above)\r\n\r\n**Design Patterns**\r\n* http://samplaid.com/samples/14 -> Example of a Guest NullObject\r\n\r\n**Custom Iterator**\r\n* https://github.com/fourcolors/pick_groups -> Uses ruby's yield to create a custom iterator for grouping arrays.\r\n\r\n**Design(ya like the art stuff)**\r\n* https://www.dropbox.com/s/2h4bb7dzu9yrigm/memorysun1.jpg -> Thank you to Bret Alimari who customized this font and has inspired me to create better designs. He's the best designer I know. http://bretsaid.com/\r\n","tagline":"A personal resume with information and code samples about me","note":"Don't delete this file!
