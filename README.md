# Hello!

My name is Sterling cobb and I'm a Software Engineer. I've been coding since I was 13 and have a deep love for open source and web technologies, but we'll get to that soon. First, a little about myself. I'm 24, living in Boston and feel I'm as creative as they come. I perform improv' comedy (when in Utah where my friends are at) and enjoy fly fishing, golfing, baseball and long boarding. I'm also madly in love with the ocean and have dreams of sailing from Boston to San Francisco someday.

Currently I'm working for thoughbot (www.thoughtbot.com) in their apprentice.io program and having a blast.

* www.samplaid.com -> This is a super easy to use code sample sharing website.
* http://tmblr.co/Zq-A5wMMXbPM -> This is the tagging system for www.apptrajectory.com It's 100% tested in jasmine, cucumber and Backbone.js

### Sample Code
Since I wrote a code sample site, I figured I would use that to link to my code samples (yes I know gist exists)

Here are all of my code samples:
