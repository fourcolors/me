I've been coding since I was 13 and have a deep love for open source and web technologies, but we'll get to that soon. First, a little about myself. I'm 24, living in Boston and feeling I'm as creative as they come. I perform improv' comedy (when in Utah where my friends are at) and enjoy fly fishing, golfing, baseball and long boarding.
