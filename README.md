# Hello!

My name is Sterling cobb and I'm a Software Engineer. I've been coding since I was 13 and have a deep love for open source and web technologies, but we'll get to that soon. First, a little about myself. I'm 24, living in Boston and feeling I'm as creative as they come. I perform improv' comedy (when in Utah where my friends are at) and enjoy fly fishing, golfing, baseball and long boarding. I'm also madly in love with the ocean and have dreams of sailing from Boston to San Francisco someday.

This is for a memory storing application I'm creating. This is an example of cleaning up my step definitions by hiding implementation into world.
