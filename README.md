# Hello!

My name is Sterling cobb and I'm a Software Engineer. I've been coding since I was 13 and have a deep love for open source and web technologies, but we'll get to that soon. First, a little about myself. I'm 24, living in Boston and feeling I'm as creative as they come. I perform improv' comedy (when in Utah where my friends are at) and enjoy fly fishing, golfing, baseball and long boarding. I'm also madely in love with the ocean and have dreams of sailing from Boston to San Fransisco someday.
